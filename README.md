My first Supervised Machine Learning - Diabetes Dataset

## MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATA ANALYSIS
Machine Learning is a method of data analysis where applications leverage existing data to discover patterns and make decisions.
It is used to classification, clustering, predictive analytics, learning associations, anomaly detection, image analysis, and natural language processing.

### Type of Machine Learning
* Supervised Learning -- dataset with labeled
  the technique of inferring a function that maps an input to an output based on the training set
  
* Unsupervised Learning  -- dataset without labeled
  the technique in which there's no training stage. only have the application input data, without any corresponding output values, have to work on their own, discovering hidden pattern in the input data.

Description of dataset:
The datasets consists of 9 columns as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Predigree Function, age and Outcome and 769 rows. 
Learned and used this dataset to making predictions - Supervised Machine Learning Models as below:-

**1) Multi Linear regression**<br>
**2) Logistic regression**<br>
**3) K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Classification**<br>
**4) Support Vector Machine**<br>
**5) Decision Tree Classifier**<br>

In summary, the highest accuracy model is Decision Tree Classifier. 
Decision Tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction for small datasets.
